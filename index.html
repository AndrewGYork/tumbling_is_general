<h4>Abstract</h4></a>
<p class="abstract">Molecular interactions are central to understanding any biological system, but they are labor-intensive to measure with most microscopy approaches. Tracking "tumbling" (rotational diffusion) is a generalizable strategy for determining particle <a href="./appendix.html#tumbling_time_particle_size">size</a>, from which the presence and size of binding partners in a complex can be inferred. However, fluorescence-based tumbling measurements have historically been limited to small targets (<30 kDa) due to the short (nanosecond) lifetime of typical fluorophores. This size cap leaves most of the proteome inaccessible, severely limiting the usefulness of the approach. To reveal larger complexes and realize the full potential of optical tumbling measurements, several groups have explored longer-lived states, such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(71)86250-1">photobleached molecules</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01489-7">reversibly photoswitched proteins</a>, or <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c01236">triggerable triplets</a>. Here, we describe four combinations of photophysics and hardware for tumbling with longer-lived states, gearing each to a candidate biological use case. We explore these four measurement schemes with simulations and, in one case, experimentally validate the approach. Our work suggests that, with minor reconfiguring, most fluorescence approaches to detect the presence of proteins could also reveal their binding state.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For 4 billion years, molecular interactions have been essential for life. Each protein, nucleic acid, or lipid in a cell is a character in a chaotic play, zooming from place to place and dancing with different partners to ultimately produce the complex behaviors of living creatures. Mapping out this cascade of interactions is a recurring challenge across biology.</p>

<p>Fluorescence microscopy reveals where molecules are, and with some care, it can also report their abundance 

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-46312-4" title="Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy; J. R. Lakowicz; ISBN 978-0-387-31278-1 (2006)">Lakowicz 2006</a>]. 

Location is a clue about function, but it's only part of the picture. To better understand function, we'd like to monitor the interactions (binding) of our protein of interest in real time in its native context. Unfortunately, fluorescence microscopy is blind to binding information without complicated add-ons, each with considerable downsides (e.g. FRET, FCS, or SPT, discussed in the <a href="./appendix.html#technology_comparison">Appendix</a>).</p>

<p>How might we extract binding information from a generalizable optical readout? Binding changes a molecule's effective size, and different binding partners yield complexes of different overall sizes. Conveniently, the rate of “tumbling” (rotational diffusion), depends on a protein complex’s <a href="./appendix.html#tumbling_time_particle_size">size</a>, with larger complexes tumbling more slowly than smaller complexes (<a href="#tumbling_animation" target="_self">Figure 1</a>, <a href="#general_tumbling_figure" target="_self">Figure 2</a>). Therefore, if we can measure tumbling rate, we can reveal molecular interactions.</p>

<p>The most common optical strategy for measuring tumbling is fluorescence anisotropy 

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1042/bj0510145" title="Polarization of the fluorescence of macromolecules. 1. Theory and experimental method; G. Weber; Biochem J., 51, 2, 145–155 (1952)">Weber 1952</a>], 

which reports how much and how fast the <a href="./appendix.html#definition_tumbling_terms">alignment</a> of a population of fluorophores scrambles during its fluorescence lifetime. Excitation with polarized light generates an initial, partially aligned subpopulation. (The more aligned a ground state fluorophore's absorption dipole is with the incoming light polarization, the more likely it is to absorb that light (<a href="#tumbling_animation" target="_self">Figure 1</a>).) Following absorption, fluorescence emission typically occurs over a few nanoseconds (the fluorescence lifetime), during which tumbling scrambles alignment. Fluorescence from each molecule is parallel to its emission dipole. The <a href="./appendix.html#definition_tumbling_terms">polarization</a> of the population's emission therefore reflects the alignment of all of the individual emission dipoles. All other things being equal, populations of faster-rotating (smaller) particles will have less aligned dipoles and will emit less polarized fluorescence.</p>

<p>Fluorescence anisotropy allows real-time monitoring of fluorescent small molecule binding. Unfortunately, fluorescence anisotropy only works when the target is small enough (\(\lessapprox\)30 kDa) that it tumbles detectably during the few-nanosecond fluorescence lifetime. The median size of a eukaryotic protein is 50 kDa 

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0968-0004(97)01171-7" title="Protein folding in the cytosol: chaperonin-dependent and -independent mechanisms; W. J. Netzer, F. U. Hartl; Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 23, 2, 68-73 (1998)">Netzer 1998</a>],

so <em>almost all protein complexes tumble too slowly to be interrogated with fluorescence anisotropy.</em></p>

<p>With tumbling, the observation time window determines the accessible mass range. If we generate a longer-lived state than the fluorescent excited state, we can measure sizes of larger particles and thereby reveal protein-protein interactions. Recognizing the value of this approach, experimenters have tried to use various long-lived states for tumbling. For example, phosphorescence emission can reveal tumbling on the millisecond time scale

Alternatively, polarized photobleaching produces an infinitely-long-lived bleached state; the remaining unbleached ground state molecules can reveal tumbling occurring in a few microseconds or up to seconds

Despite having been around for decades, these techniques are not widely used. Phosphorescence is limited by very low signal in the <a href="./appendix.html#cellular_tumbling_times">relevant time window</a> (<10 &mu;s) for soluble protein-protein interactions. The damage caused to samples by photobleaching is unappealing for live imaging, and typical measurement schemes rely on deep bleaching from a single pulse, which is difficult to achieve in practice within a 10 &mu;s time window

<p>Recently, the discovery of long-lived states with triggerable emission in fluorescent proteins has opened up exciting new possibilities for tumbling measurements on protein complexes.

used the active state of a reversible photoswitchable protein (rsFP) to monitor tumbling over long timescales. Building on this work,

showed the same principle applies with triggerable fluorescence from a triplet state (termed "optically activated delayed fluorescence"). Beyond just extending the size range, these "triggerable emitters" offer a crucial level of control over the timing of photon production. Unlike fluorescence or phosphorescence, where photons are emitted spontaneously over a defined lifetime, triggerable emitters produce photons on demand, allowing the experimenter to concentrate their limited photon budget into times when it is maximally informative. The value of certain measurement times over others can be seen in <a href="#general_tumbling_figure" target="_self">Figure 2</a>, where the alignment difference between the 100 and 200 nm beads is much larger at 20 &mu;s than at 2 &mu;s. Thus, triggerable emitters improve both the size range and the signal-to-noise ratio of a tumbling measurement.</p>

enable new pulse schemes and hardware configurations ranging far beyond the point-scanning confocal approach typically used for fluorescence anisotropy. In this work, we explore tumbling with three different photophysics (photobleaching, rsFPs, triggered triplets) and four hardware configurations (<a href="#power_variation_section" target="_self">a plate reader</a>, <a href="#camera_section" target="_self">a high throughput imaging system</a>, <a href="#flow_section" target="_self">a cell sorter</a>, and <a href="#experimental_section" target="_self">a confocal microscope</a>). To facilitate these investigations, we first develop and then apply open-source simulation code. We put particular emphasis on pump-probe measurement schemes with triggerable triplets, and we demonstrate the feasibility and accessibility of this approach with data from a commercial confocal microscope. In the future, we envision that tumbling measurements will be possible on most imaging hardware, as available as red and green color channels are today.</p>

<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>

<h4>Tumbling Simulation Code</h4>

<p>We developed numerical simulation code to explore diverse tumbling measurements. We conceptualize tumbling as diffusion on the surface of a sphere, where each point represents a particle's orientation (as shown in <a href="#general_tumbling_figure" target="_self">Figure 2</a>). We model the diffusion of these points with the numerical approximation described by 

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1303.1278" title="A &quot;Gaussian&quot; for diffusion on the sphere; A. Ghosh, J. Samuel, arXiv:1303.1278v1 (2013)">Ghosh 2013</a>]. 

All of the particles in our simulations are spherical with uniform density, and we assume that viscosity and temperature are held constant. We also assume that all absorption and emission dipoles are parallel.</p>

<p>The simulation tracks each particle's orientation and photophysical state (e.g. ground, excited singlet, triplet) as it tumbles over time. We model two types of state transitions: spontaneous and light-driven. Spontaneous transitions occur from one state to another over time; for example, a fluorescent excited state decays to the ground state with a lifetime of a few nanoseconds. Light-driven transitions are instantaneous in our simulations and occur from one specified state to another; for example, a ground state molecule absorbs light and enters the fluorescent excited state. For light-driven transitions, we choose to specify light intensity in "saturation units," where intensity x excites a fraction of aligned molecules equal to 1-2<sup>-x</sup>. A particle's probability of undergoing a light-driven transition also depends on the angle between its orientation (absorption dipole) and the polarization of the incoming light.</p>

<p>Our tumbling simulations share some commonalities. Polarized light excites a population of fluorophores, and their emission is split between two detectors, one that collects light with polarization aligned to the input beam (parallel, &parallel;) and the other with polarization perpendicular (&perp;) to the input beam. We choose to represent the relative amounts of these two signals with the <a href="./appendix.html#definition_tumbling_terms">polarization</a>, which ranges from 1 (all &parallel;) to -1 (all &perp;). Immobile, randomly oriented fluorophores excited with linearly polarized light fluoresce with a polarization of 0.5 (3:1 &parallel;:&perp; ratio)

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-46312-4" title="Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy; J. R. Lakowicz; ISBN 978-0-387-31278-1 (2006)">Lakowicz 2006</a>]. 

Fluorophores that rotate much faster than the emission fluoresce with polarization&approx;0. Rates of rotation that are similar to the rate of emission result in polarization between 0 and 0.5.</p>

<p>We suspect that much of the benefit of the simulation code lies in empowering others to use it. In that spirit, we include a <a href="./appendix.html#code_usage_examples">short tutorial</a> that simulates fluorescence anisotropy. Furthermore, all of the code to generate the simulations in this work is available on <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGYork/tumbling_is_general">GitHub</a>. For faster performance, a <a href="https://github.com/aelefebv/Rotational_diffusion-AELxJLD/tree/main">GPU-accelerated version</a> is also available.</p>

<h4 id="power_variation_section">Simulation 1: Power variation on a plate reader</h4>

<p>We first simulate a tumbling measurement with minimal photophysics and hardware, geared towards in vitro measurements in a bulk solution. We model a fluorophore that is capable of two photophysical processes: fluorescence emission and photobleaching. Previous implementations of tumbling with photobleaching used an intense polarized light pulse to bleach out a subset of the ground state orientations

[e.g. <a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(81)84717-0" title="Measurement of rotational motion in membranes using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; L.M. Smith, R.M. Weis, H.M. McConnell; Biophysical Journal, 36, 1, 73-91 (1981)">Smith 1981</a>,

The experimenters then used lower intensity illumination to track the scrambling of this "etched" ground state distribution. To access timescales relevant for protein-protein interactions, previous approaches require rapid photobleaching kinetics, high powers, and sub-microsecond detector time resolution, which would be difficult to achieve with low-cost hardware. Here, we take a more minimal, plate-reader compatible approach. We use a single, linearly polarized beam, which continuously illuminates a sample while two detectors integrate <a href="./appendix.html#definition_tumbling_terms">polarization</a> of the output fluorescence (<a href="#power_variation_figure" target="_self">Figure 3</a> with <code>Photobleaching</code> selected).</p>

  <strong>(A)</strong> Cartoon of the simulated experiment, with a laser (light blue) illuminating a bulk solution (e.g. in a cuvette). Two detectors record polarization of the fluorescence emission (green) after a polarizing beam splitter (PBS).

<p>It is convenient to imagine the time course of this bleaching experiment (<a href="#power_variation_figure" target="_self">Figure 3C</a>, Option <code>Photobleaching</code>), even though the final signal can be analyzed in a time-integrated manner. For a fully immobile population, high laser intensity will strongly etch the orientation distribution of the ground state population. Initially, emission will be mostly parallel to the excitation beam, but as bleaching progresses, very few ground state fluorophores will remain parallel to the excitation beam. The remaining fluorophores are mostly perpendicular to the excitation beam, so the detected emissions are more likely to be in the perpendicular channel (lower polarization). Conversely, a population that is rotating rapidly will repopulate the parallel channel and retain high polarization over time, even as the total fluorescence decreases from bleaching. The relative rates of photobleaching and rotation determine the integrated polarization. By varying the laser power one can vary the rate of photobleaching and obtain a spectrum. Although photobleaching is irreversible and destructive to the sample, even a moderate sample volume would be able to diffusively replenish the signal, allowing repeat measurements.</p>

<p>If we allow ourselves to swap out the fluorophore and not rely on photobleaching alone, a reversible photoswitchable fluorescent protein (rsFP) would be an upgrade to the above approach. rsFPs can be switched between an inactive (dark) and an active ground state with different colors of light 

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2013.05.031" title="Photoswitchable Fluorescent Proteins: Ten Years of Colorful Chemistry and Exciting Applications; X. X. Zhou, M. Z. Lin, 17, 4, 682–690. (2013)">Zhou 2013</a>]. 

Most simply, rsFPs allow ‘resetting’ to reuse the same molecules for successive measurements. Alternatively, the on- and off-switching lasers could be on simultaneously, thereby regenerating the sample during the measurement (<a href="#power_variation_figure" target="_self">Figure 3</a> with <code>Reversible Photoswitching</code> selected). With certain rsFPs (e.g. rsEGFP2), the off-switching wavelength is the same as the wavelength that produces fluorescence, in a clean analogy to the photobleaching case above. By varying the power of the off-switching laser, we are tuning the lifetime of the active state while we obtain fluorescent signal. Because these measurements reveal the relative rates of tumbling and some photophysical process, tuning the lifetime of the photophysical process can reveal the tumbling rate and therefore size. We predict that this setup will yield clear signals even for very low numbers of fluorophores (100 total in the simulation).</p>

<p>Our power variation scheme could be applied, for example, with commercially available antibodies in a plate reader to determine level of aggregation of the antibody’s target in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. It also could be deployed as an alternative to the common co-immunoprecipitation or “pulldown” assay to determine whether a labeled target protein is bound to any additional molecules in a mixture.</p>

<h4 id="camera_section">Simulation 2: Spatially resolving binding with triplets</h4>

<p>Often, we would like to map the interactions of a protein of interest across a cell or tissue, ideally over a large field of view simultaneously. A standard scientific camera can acquire a snapshot every few milliseconds, but tumbling involves nanosecond- or microsecond-scale dynamics. To obtain the necessary time resolution, tumbling is typically recorded with a fast, single pixel detector

<p>With current detector technology, a “pump-probe” imaging scheme is compelling, in which the time resolution is encoded by a variable delay between pump and probe laser pulses. Each snapshot records a single delay time, and a modest number of points in the tumbling decay curve can be acquired as a series of snapshots at varying delays (<a href="#triplets_camera_figure" target="_self">Figure 4</a>, left panel). Critically, such an approach would be compatible with widefield imaging or with state-of-the-art lightsheet microscopes

<p>A pump-probe pulse scheme doesn't discard photons that arrive outside of the "probe" time window; it simply doesn't generate them. To achieve this, we need a long-lived state that can be triggered to emit at a time of interest, such as a reversibly switchable fluorescent protein (rsFPs, discussed above) or a triggered triplet. Triggered triplets (also known as optically activated delayed fluorescence) refers to millisecond-lived triplet states that can emit prompt fluorescence when excited with far-red light

Triplets can be generated from the excited singlet, leading to a convenient pulse scheme where a pump pulse at the traditional absorption wavelength (say, 488 nm for fluorescein) is followed by a far-red probe pulse

Here, we focus on triplets rather than rsFPs because of their superior time flexibility, in principle accessing timescales as short as hundreds of nanoseconds; a more detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of these two options is available in the <a href="./appendix.html#photophysics_comparison">Appendix</a>.

<p>To explore pump-probe measurements with triggered triplets (<a href="#triplets_camera_figure" target="_self">Figure 4</a>), we simulated a linearly polarized pump pulse and an orthogonally polarized probe (trigger) pulse. Two gated but otherwise standard cameras record fluorescence following a polarizing beamsplitter. We simulate a sample of labeled protein with three binding states: unbound, bound to a small partner, or bound to a large partner. All three binding states are distinguishable. Importantly, a mixture of the unbound and large states is also distinguishable from a binding partner of intermediate mass; we anticipate such mixtures will be the norm in a real sample.

  <strong>(A)</strong> Schematic of a pump-probe measurement with triggered triplets. The pump pulse (blue) generates fluorescence (green) in the sample. Some of these fluorescent molecules convert to triplets (faint pink), which, after a variable delay, are triggered to fluoresce (green) by the probe beam (pink). A fast shutter separates signal from the pump and probe pulses. A polarizing beamsplitter followed by two cameras records the polarized fluorescence at all points in the image. A sequence of delays is captured by successive images. Inset from sample shows a cartoon representation of how tumbling times could correspond to spatially compartmentalized binding events within a cell. 
  <strong>(B)</strong> Simulation results for spheres with tumbling times of 450 ("unbound"), 900 ("small complex"), and 3000 ns ("large complex"), as well as an equal part mixture of spheres with 450 and 3000 ns tumbling times. 50 ns pump and probe pulses were simulated as 10 discrete phototransitions of intensity 0.25, each 5 ns apart. Because of the saturating intensity used in these simulations, polarization values deviate from the ideal of 0.5 for fully equilibrated samples. Points indicate means of 6 replicates, with shaded areas indicating &plusmn; standard deviation.

<p>The primary drawback of triggered triplets is the low numbers of photons per molecule. The &approx;1% quantum yield of triplet generation in existing fluorescent proteins

is partially responsible for this. More fundamentally, each triplet molecule emits at most one photon on its path to the ground state. To obtain sufficient signal despite this, we simulated a large number of molecules, which can be thought of as either spatially binning the image or acquiring many cycles from the same molecules. In the latter case, the millisecond spontaneous decay of the triplet is advantageous, resetting the sample to its original state for subsequent cycles. The effects of triplet quantum yield and number of molecules on the signal-to-noise ratio can be explored through the drop-down options in Figure 4.</p>

<h4 id="flow_section">Simulation 3: Recording binding state in high throughput with a flow cytometer</h4>

<p>In addition to camera-based recording, pump-probe tumbling schemes enable flow cytometry readouts (<a href="#triplets_flow_figure" target="_self">Figure 5</a>), dramatically increasing throughput. This throughput opens up the possibility of binding measurements across many conditions, e.g. in large genetic perturbation libraries. Such an approach could characterize the effect of mutagenesis or knockout on protein-protein interactions at scale.</p>

<p>Time delays in a flow setup could be achieved either via physical spacing of the pump and probe laser along the object’s path or via time-resolved lasers and detectors. With a linear flow rate of 10 m/s

a cell would move 50 &mu;m in 1 &mu;s. Two 10 &mu;m wide laser spots separated by 50 &mu;m would produce a 1 &mu;s delay; a sequence of beam spacings produces a sequence of delays. Flow cytometers often incorporate additional spectral channels in this manner, so this proposal requires minimal modification of existing systems. For time delays shorter than 500 ns, pump-probe pairs could also be delivered within the dwell time of the cell in a particular focused spot, provided that the detector was able to gate out any emission generated by the pump pulse.</p>

<p>A key difference between this approach and a camera-based system (<a href="#triplets_camera_figure" target="_self">Figure 4</a>) is that it would be inconvenient to wait for milliseconds for untriggered triplets to naturally decay. With flow rates fast enough to achieve microsecond delays, millisecond wait times in between measurements would involve long additional fluidic lines. To allow successive pump-probe sequences without excessive buildup of triplets, we simulate a circularly polarized probe beam (<a href="#triplets_flow_figure" target="_self">Figure 5</a> with <code>Circular</code> selected), which increases the polarization differences between particle sizes versus using a linearly polarized beam (<a href="#triplets_flow_figure" target="_self">Figure 5</a> with <code>Linear</code> selected).</p>

<h4 id="experimental_section">Experimental demonstration of triggered triplet tumbling</h4>

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of pump probe pulse schemes with triggered triplets, we made a tumbling measurement on our confocal microscope. Although the functionality is not unmasked in software, the necessary hardware exists on certain commercial systems (in this case, Leica SP8, <a href="./appendix.html#SP8_schematic_figure">Figure S1</a>). We used linearly polarized illumination to pump fluorophores into the triplet state and orthogonally polarized 775 nm light to <a href="./appendix.html#crescent_selection">confine the triplet population</a> and to trigger triplets to emit. We used successive sweeps of the resonant scanner to interrogate the sample at 60 &mu;s intervals.</p>

we found that low-intensity 775 nm illumination produced fluorescence only if the sample was previously illuminated at 488 nm (mVenus) or 561 nm (mScarlet), suggesting that the initial pulse generated a long-lived triggerable state (i.e. a triplet, <a href="./appendix.html#SP8_schematic_figure">Figure S1</a>). mVenus’s triplet lifetime was reported to be approximately 1 ms

we replicate this and observe a similar triplet lifetime for mScarlet (<a href="./appendix.html#triplet_lifetimes_figure">Figure S4</a>).

<h4>Outlook</h4>

<p>Determinations of size&mdash;and therefore binding&mdash;with tumbling are a straightforward and generalizable way to address recurring questions about protein-protein interactions. As <a href="./appendix.html#technology_comparison">discussed in the Appendix</a>, tumbling can in theory outperform existing optical methods for measuring interactions. By tracking rotational diffusion in bulk rather than the translation of single molecules, tumbling measurements are faster and more sensitive than FCS or SPT. By allowing single label measurements without prior structural information, tumbling measurements are a richer and more generalizable binding assay than FRET.</p>

<p>Tumbling can be measured with diverse hardware, making it as attractive in a hand-held or plate-reader format as in a high-resolution imaging system. We have demonstrated that tumbling measurements on nanometer-scale objects are possible with commercially available microscope systems; with software modifications, these measurements could be easy. In addition to a more standard confocal setup, we proposed and simulated tumbling measurements in plate reader, camera-based, and flow cytometry format, each optimized towards protein-protein interaction measurements in a distinct application area. To the best of our knowledge, these systems have not been previously described but would be possible to construct, and our team plans to build in this space in the future.</p>

<p>Most protein-protein interaction assays are confirmatory: the experimenter suspects that two proteins interact and they want to verify this. An idealized tumbling experiment goes far beyond this: it's a discovery engine that, from a single labeled protein, could report the sizes of all interaction partners, resolved across space and time. Such a tool, when fully realized, will bring us ever closer to understanding the cascades of molecular interactions that underlie life.</p>
